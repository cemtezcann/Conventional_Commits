### **Conventional_Commits**
---
- The commit message should be structured as follows:

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- **fix**: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- **feat**: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
- footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.
